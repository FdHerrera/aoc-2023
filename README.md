# Advent of Code 2023 - Java Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2023 repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges implemented in Java. Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants solve two coding challenges every day leading up to Christmas. It's a great opportunity to improve your problem-solving skills and learn new programming techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into packages corresponding to each day's challenge. Inside each package, you will find the Java files containing the solutions and any necessary supporting files. The main method in each file is used to run and test the solution.

                        └── input
                             └── dayone.txt
                             └── daytwo.txt
                             └── ...

```

## Input Files

Input files for each day's challenge are defined as "dayxxx.txt" in the resources package of the tests. These files contain the puzzle input necessary for the solutions to work correctly.
